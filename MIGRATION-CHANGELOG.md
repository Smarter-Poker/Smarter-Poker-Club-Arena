## Step 1 — RIP OUT Client-Side Engine Code

### Phase: COMPLETED 2026-03-24

**File: `src/pages/TablePage.tsx`**

**Removed (~780 lines net):**

1. **Engine imports removed (5 of 6):**
   - `Deck, compareHands, calculatePots, determineWinners` from `PokerEngine`
   - `HandController` from `HandController`
   - `serverActionValidator` from `ServerActionValidator`
   - `OFCPineappleEngine` from `OFCPineappleEngine`
   - `monteCarloEquity` from `MonteCarloEquity`
   - **KEPT:** `timeBankEngine` — deferred to Step 5 (8 active callsites)

2. **HandController initialization block removed (~940 lines):**
   - `handControllerRef` declaration + all 51 references → **0 remaining**
   - `handController` state + `setHandController` → removed
   - `handInProgressRef` → removed
   - `startNextHandRef` function body → removed (entire HC creation, config, event subscription)
   - All HC event handlers: HAND_START, CARDS_DEALT, COMMUNITY_CARDS, POT_UPDATE, PLAYER_ACTION, TURN_CHANGE, SHOWDOWN, WINNERS, HAND_COMPLETE
   - Horse auto-action logic (HydraService decision → HC performAction)
   - `handPersistenceService.wireToHandController()` call
   - First-hand trigger `useEffect` watching `tableState.players`

3. **`broadcastLocalHandState` function removed:**
   - Function declaration (was `useCallback` wrapping `broadcastHandState()`)
   - All 14 call sites across action handlers
   - `broadcastHandState` removed from supabase import (unused)

4. **Action handlers migrated to server-only:**
   - `handleFold` — local `performAction('fold')` removed, `submitAction` is now primary (awaited)
   - `handleCheck` — same pattern
   - `handleCall` — same pattern
   - `handleActionPanelAction` — all 5 cases (fold/check/call/raise/allin) cleaned
   - `handleConfirmRaise` — local engine call removed
   - `handleAllIn` — local engine call removed
   - `handleTimerAutoFold` — local engine call removed, `submitAction` only

5. **`validateAndExecuteAction` simplified:**
   - Removed `serverActionValidator.validate()` dependency
   - Removed `handControllerRef.current.getState()` for validation context
   - Now does basic client-side guard only (fold always allowed, check hero exists)
   - Server performs real validation

6. **HC state reads replaced with `tableState` (Zustand):**
   - Keyboard shortcut 'C' handler — `hcState.currentBet` → `tableState.lastBetAmounts`
   - `useTableKeyboard` `onCallCheck` — same replacement
   - `onBetPreset` — `state.pot` → `tableState.pot`
   - Pre-action check/callAny handlers — same replacement
   - ActionPanel render props (`canCheck`, `callAmount`, `minRaise`) — derived from `tableState`
   - PreActionBar `canCheck` prop — derived from `tableState`

7. **`monteCarloEquity` call replaced:**
   - Insurance equity calculation now uses heuristic fallback
   - TODO marker left for server-side equity endpoint (Step 3)

8. **Rabbit hunt handler updated:**
   - Removed `handControllerRef.current?.getState()?.deck` access
   - Falls through to random card generation (server-side rabbit hunt in Step 3)

9. **Comment cleanup:**
   - "LOCAL engine is authoritative" comments → removed or updated
   - "Use HC's authoritative pot value" → removed
   - HandController references in section headers → neutralized

**What the client KEEPS (correct behavior):**
- `submitAction()` from GameServerAPI — HTTP POST to server (PRIMARY)
- `sendAction()` from useTableWebSocket — WebSocket action send
- `subscribeToHandState()` — Supabase Realtime listener
- All UI rendering — cards, chips, animations, sounds
- All Zustand state — populated by server events
- `timeBankEngine` — deferred to Step 5

**Verification (grep):**
- `handControllerRef`: 0 matches ✅
- `broadcastLocalHandState`: 0 non-comment matches ✅
- `.performAction(`: 0 matches ✅
- `monteCarloEquity`: 0 non-comment matches ✅
- `serverActionValidator`: 0 non-comment matches ✅
- Engine imports (`from '../engine/`): only `timeBankEngine` (Step 5) ✅

**Next:** Step 2 — VERIFY CLEAN (full grep confirms zero local authoritative state)

---

## Step 2 — VERIFY CLEAN (Mandatory Gate)

### Phase: COMPLETED 2026-03-24

**Scope:** Comprehensive grep of entire `src/` directory — NOT just TablePage.tsx.

**Grep 1: `handControllerRef | new HandController | .performAction(`**
- `src/pages/TablePage.tsx`: 0 matches ✅
- `src/engine/HeadlessTableEngine.ts`: multiple matches → EXPECTED (this IS the server engine, Step 4+)
- `src/engine/demo.ts`: 4 matches → EXPECTED (demo/test file, not gameplay UI)
- All other UI files: 0 matches ✅

**Grep 2: Engine imports in UI components (`from '../engine/'`)**
- `TablePage.tsx` → only `timeBankEngine` (deferred to Step 5) ✅
- `FlashPoolPage.tsx` → `flashPoolEngine` (deferred to Phase 6 per catalog) ✅
- `admin/EngineDashboard.tsx` → orchestrators (admin dashboard, not gameplay) ✅
- `StraddleToggle.tsx` → `straddleEngine` (deferred to Step 4 per catalog) ✅
- `HydraService.ts`, `BBJService.ts`, `HandPersistenceService.ts`, `SpinItWheel.tsx` → TYPE-ONLY imports (safe) ✅
- `RakeService.ts`, `FinancialCronService.ts` → `rakebackEngine` (Phase 6 per catalog) ✅

**Grep 3: "authoritative" claims in client code**
- `TablePage.tsx` → only Step 1 migration markers ("server is authoritative") ✅
- `GameServerAPI.ts` → correct: "server is the AUTHORITATIVE source" ✅
- All engine files → correct: server-side code claiming authority ✅
- Zero "client is authoritative" or "LOCAL engine is authoritative" claims remain ✅

**Grep 4: `broadcastLocalHandState | broadcastHandState`**
- `TablePage.tsx` → 0 non-comment matches (only migration marker comment) ✅
- `lib/supabase.ts` → function definition (kept, used by server engine) ✅
- `HeadlessTableEngine.ts` → server-side usage (correct) ✅

**GATE RESULT: PASS** — Zero client-side authoritative engine code remains in UI components. All remaining engine references are either server-side (correct), type-only (safe), or explicitly deferred to later phases per the removal catalog.

**Next:** Step 3 — FIX SERVER BLOCKERS (card security, auto-fold, timer)

---

## Step 3 — FIX SERVER BLOCKERS

### Phase: IN PROGRESS 2026-03-24

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/engine/ServerTableEngine.ts` (3 server fixes)
- `src/pages/TablePage.tsx` (1 client fix for card handling)

---

### BLOCKER #1: Card Security — Hole Cards Leaked via Broadcast

**File:** `server/src/engine/ServerTableEngine.ts`

**Problem:** `broadcastCurrentState()` at line 792 sent `cards: p.cards ?? []` for ALL players to ALL subscribers via Supabase Realtime. Anyone inspecting the WebSocket payload could see every player's hole cards.

**Fix A — Scrub cards from broadcast (line ~849):**

**Before:**
```typescript
cards: p.cards ?? [],
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only reveal cards at showdown for players still in the hand (not folded)
cards: (state.stage === 'showdown' && !p.is_folded) ? (p.cards ?? []) : [],
```

**Fix B — Write cards to RLS-protected table (new CARDS_DEALT handler, lines 604-635):**

Added a `CARDS_DEALT` case to `handleHandEvent()` that writes each player's dealt cards to the `table_hole_cards` table via the existing `insert_hole_cards` RPC. This table has Row Level Security: `USING (auth.uid() = user_id)` — each player can only read their own cards.

The client already subscribes to `table_hole_cards` INSERT events (via `useMasterBusChannel` at TablePage line 1489-1496) and falls back to a direct query on reconnect (line 1501-1510). No client-side card delivery changes needed.

**Fix C — Client card handling for scrubbed broadcasts (TablePage.tsx line ~1576-1591):**

**Before:**
```typescript
holeCards: isHero ? sp.cards || existing?.holeCards || [] : existing?.holeCards || [],
showCards: isHero,
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Card security: server scrubs hole cards in broadcast (sends []) except at showdown.
// Hero gets cards via RLS-protected table_hole_cards channel.
// At showdown, server sends actual cards for all players → use sp.cards.
holeCards: sp.cards && sp.cards.length > 0
  ? sp.cards
  : existing?.holeCards || [],
// Show cards for hero always; show opponent cards at showdown ONLY if not folded
showCards: isHero || (sp.cards && sp.cards.length > 0 && !sp.is_folded),
```

**Why the old code was broken:** Empty arrays `[]` are truthy in JavaScript, so `sp.cards || existing?.holeCards` resolved to `[]` (the scrubbed empty array), wiping out the hero's stored cards on every broadcast.

**Verified:** Re-read both files after changes ✅

### BLOCKER #2: Auto-Fold on Error

**File:** `server/src/engine/ServerTableEngine.ts` (lines 347-354)

**Problem:** When `performAction()` threw an error (e.g., invalid raise amount), the catch block auto-folded the player. A typo in a bet amount shouldn't cost you your hand.

**Before:**
```typescript
} catch (err) {
  const errMsg = err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Action failed';
  console.warn(`[ServerTableEngine:${this.tableId}] Player action failed:`, errMsg);
  // Auto-fold on invalid action
  try {
    this.handController.performAction(seat, 'fold');
    return { success: true, error: `Original action failed, auto-folded: ${errMsg}` };
  } catch {
    return { success: false, error: errMsg };
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} catch (err) {
  const errMsg = err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Action failed';
  console.warn(`[ServerTableEngine:${this.tableId}] Player action failed:`, errMsg);
  // Return error to client — do NOT auto-fold. The player should see the error
  // and choose their next action. Auto-folding on invalid actions silently
  // destroys hands (e.g., a raise with wrong amount shouldn't fold the player).
  return { success: false, error: errMsg };
}
```

**Verified:** Re-read file after change ✅

---

### BLOCKER #3: Timer Auto-Check Logic

**File:** `server/src/engine/ServerTableEngine.ts` (lines 192-230)

**Problem:** When a player's timer expired, the server ALWAYS auto-folded — even when no bet was outstanding and the player could simply check. Standard poker: if you can check, time-out = auto-check.

**Before:**
```typescript
this.playerTurnTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  // ... guard checks ...
  console.warn(`... Auto-folding.`);
  try {
    this.handController.performAction(seat, 'fold');
  } catch (err) { ... }
}, safeDurationSeconds * 1000);
```

**After:**
```typescript
this.playerTurnTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  // ... guard checks ...
  const player = state.players.find((p) => p.seat === seat);
  const amountToCall = player ? Math.max(0, state.currentBet - (player.bet ?? 0)) : 0;
  const canCheck = amountToCall === 0;

  if (canCheck) {
    // No bet outstanding → auto-check (standard poker behavior)
    this.handController.performAction(seat, 'check');
    // Fallback to fold if check somehow fails
  } else {
    // Bet outstanding → auto-fold
    this.handController.performAction(seat, 'fold');
  }
}, safeDurationSeconds * 1000);
```

**Verified:** Re-read file after change ✅
