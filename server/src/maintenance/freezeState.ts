/**
 * THE PROCESS-WIDE FREEZE FLAG (Dan, 2026-09-01).
 *
 * "THE ENTIRE PLATFORM NEEDS TO FREEZE FOR THE 5 MINUTES ... HORSES SHOULD
 * NOT STAND UP OR ROTATE, EVERYTHING JUST FREEZES."
 *
 * One module-level boolean, set only by MaintenanceBreak, read by every
 * periodic sweep that moves money or seats. It exists because those sweeps
 * live in a dozen services that have no reference to the GameServer instance,
 * and threading a supplier through every constructor would touch far more
 * code than the guarantee needs.
 *
 * The flag is the ENGINE'S half of the freeze. The other half lives in
 * Postgres (fn_platform_frozen + the zz_freeze_guard triggers), because the
 * engine is dead for ~2 of the 5 minutes and pg_cron and browsers do not stop
 * when it does. The two halves are armed by the same row in
 * engine_maintenance_break, so they cannot disagree about whether a freeze is
 * running.
 *
 * Set from the ANNOUNCEMENT (:53), not the countdown (:55), deliberately: a
 * horse standing up at :54 while the felt says "Last Hand" is the same tell
 * as one standing up at :56, and no sweep this gates does anything that
 * cannot wait seven minutes.
