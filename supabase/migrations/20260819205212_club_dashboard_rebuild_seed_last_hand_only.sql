-- BACKFILLED 2026-09-27 from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations.statements.
-- Applied to production as 20260819205212 "club_dashboard_rebuild_seed_last_hand_only"; the .sql file was never committed
-- at the time. Everything below this header is byte-exact to what ran:
-- md5 37ce67742751bc440841c2d92a145722 of array_to_string(statements, chr(10)) || chr(10).
-- Do NOT re-apply; it is already live.

-- Perf: the rebuild seeded club_member_table_state with a DISTINCT ON over
-- EVERY player row of the table, which sorts the whole table's history and
-- timed out on the large clubs' tables.
--
-- Only the final hand can matter. Adjacency requires that no hand ran at the
-- table without the player, so a player absent from the last hand is
-- non-adjacent to the next hand no matter what state we store — they will
-- correctly re-baseline. Seeding from the last hand alone is therefore
-- equivalent and reads one row instead of the full history.
