--  A PRIZE DEBIT IS NOT A PAYMENT (2026-08-28)
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
-- `fn_tournament_payout_reconcile` answers "what has this player actually been
-- paid for this event" with:
--
--     SELECT SUM(wt.amount) ... WHERE category = 'prize' AND user_id = holder
--
-- and NEVER LOOKS AT `wt.type`. Every corrective debit in the prize category is
-- therefore counted as though it were another payment.
--
-- It fails in both directions, and the dangerous one is silent:
--
--   * PHANTOM OVERPAYMENTS. Union PKO Afternoon 4f42d847 was repriced on
--     2026-08-28 (migration ..._renumber_ladder_and_rebalance): eight horses
--     were debited a total of 120.00 so the paid places would sum to the pool
--     exactly. The reconciler then read kenneth sousa 2's 120.00 credit PLUS
--     the 30.00 debit as 150.00 paid against an expected 90.00 and reported
--     seven "overpaid" issues on an event whose ledger is exactly right. It
--     also files every issue list as a `critical` financial_alert, so a clean
--     event raises a false alarm that a human then has to clear.
--
--   * MASKED UNDERPAYMENTS, which is worse. A debit inflates `already_paid`,
--     so a player who was refunded and is genuinely still owed money looks
--     paid, `v_delta` never exceeds the threshold, and the top-up this
--     function exists to make is never made. Nothing reports that.
--
-- The rule is `type`, not sign, because the two conventions are both present
-- in the data: the eight rows written on 2026-08-28 are POSITIVE amounts with
-- type='debit', while the single earlier row (2026-08-15, "Reversal of
-- incorrect 1st-place prize") is a NEGATIVE amount with type='debit'.
-- Negating the absolute value is correct for both and cannot be fooled by
-- whichever convention the next writer picks. Credits are left as they are
-- and are all positive (54,723 rows, min 0.01), so nothing about the normal
-- path changes.
--
-- Behaviour is otherwise untouched: same trim, same normalisation, same
-- residual-on-last-place, same refusal to claw back automatically.
--
-- ROLLBACK: restore the previous body by replacing the v_paid SELECT with
--   SELECT round(COALESCE(SUM(wt.amount), 0), 2) INTO v_paid
-- (do not, unless the reason is understood — that is the defect).
