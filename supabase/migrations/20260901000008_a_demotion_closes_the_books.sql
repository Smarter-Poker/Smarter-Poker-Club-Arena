-- =============================================================================
-- A DEMOTION CLOSES THE BOOKS
-- =============================================================================
-- 2026-08-31, phase 4 of 7 of the agent credit and promotion lifecycle work.
--
-- THE DEFECT. fn_club_set_member_role demoted an agent by setting their agents
-- row to 'suspended' and asking nothing about what the row was holding. It did
-- not look at agent_wallet_balance, credit_used or pending_commission.
--
-- Measured on production before this file was written:
--
--     active agents .......................... 111
--     holding float .......................... 67
--     chips in those wallets ................. 6,726,000
--     owing credit ........................... 0
--     owed commission ........................ 5  (26,859.87 chips)
--
-- WHY THE CHIPS BECOME UNREACHABLE. Every role except 'player' may hold an
-- agent wallet - Dan, 2026-08-31: "OWNERS AND CO OWNERS CAN AND SHOULD HAVE
-- AGENT WALLETS." So a move to co-owner, admin, or another agent tier strands
-- nothing; the wallet goes with them. Becoming a PLAYER is the one move that
-- takes it away: fn_club_bank_role then answers 'player', and both
-- fn_agent_wallet_send and fn_agent_wallet_claim_back refuse that role outright.
-- Whatever the row still held is chips nobody can move, sitting in a pool
-- fn_club_chip_circulation does not count.
--
-- WHAT THIS MIGRATION DOES
--   1. Refuses a demotion to player while the agents row holds float or owes
--      credit, naming BOTH numbers and the remedy, and returning
--      needs_settlement so a client can act on it rather than parse prose.
--   2. Suspends the agents row ONLY when the member becomes a player. It used
--      to suspend on any move out of the agent tiers, including a PROMOTION to
--      co-owner or admin - which contradicted the rule that staff hold agent
--      wallets, and left the club bank funding a row marked inactive.
--   3. Reports pending_commission on every successful role change.
--
-- NO NEW SETTLE PATH IS INVENTED, because one already exists.
-- fn_club_bank_claim_back(club, from_user, amount, 'agent_wallet', reason,
-- op_id) pulls the float back into the club bank: it is idempotent on op_id,
-- writes a chip_transactions row, and any owner, co-owner, admin or super agent
-- may call it. The refusal names it. A DEBT is not sweepable and must be
-- settled instead: fn_apply_credit_payment pays credit_used down when the
-- invoice is paid (phase 1).
--
-- WHY pending_commission DOES NOT BLOCK. It is money the CLUB owes the AGENT.
-- The agents row survives a demotion with the figure intact, so moving the role
-- loses nothing - and there is no payout path to send anyone to yet; phase 6
-- builds one. Blocking on it would strand the club behind its own unpaid
-- obligation, with no way out. It is returned instead, so the caller can say it
-- out loud. The phase 4 plan said to refuse on all three; this is a deliberate
-- departure from it, and the reason is written here rather than left implied.
--
-- NOT REPAIRED, DELIBERATELY: the "11 orphaned uplines". Re-measured today, all
-- 11 point at a club OWNER, and that owner holds an active agents row. Under
-- Dan's correction that owners hold agent wallets, that is legitimate data and
-- there is nothing to repair. The 9 out-of-band rows are a commercial question
-- and are reported to Dan rather than rewritten.
--
-- The signature is unchanged, so this is a plain CREATE OR REPLACE: no DROP, no
-- ACL reset, no re-GRANT needed. No table is touched and no lock is taken.

-- One function body, unchanged signature, no data written. Restore
-- fn_club_set_member_role from 20260901000002 in a single statement.
--
-- Reverting re-opens the defect: a demotion to player would again suspend an
-- agents row holding chips that only an agent role can spend, and would again
-- suspend the row of a member PROMOTED to co-owner or admin, who is supposed to
-- keep their wallet. Nothing needs unwinding - this migration writes no rows.
