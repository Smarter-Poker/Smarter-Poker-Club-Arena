-- Third false CRITICAL page on the same oscillation signature (23:05 -1790,
-- 01:05 -1167, 04:05 -954): the felt component reads live table stacks
-- mid-pot, so single-interval unexplained swings +/- 1-2K at snapshot
-- instants, and three negatives clustering in one 4h window crossed the
-- trailing threshold. Proven live at 04:3x: a fresh mid-interval
-- reconciliation read +37.23 - the -954 had already reverted. A real leak
-- is same-sign interval after interval (the 15:05-20:05 mint era was seven
-- consecutive positives); oscillation flips sign.
--
-- The page rule becomes: CRITICAL only when this interval AND the previous
-- interval are both beyond 100 with the SAME SIGN and the trailing 4h sum
-- is beyond 2000 - or a single interval is catastrophic (beyond 25,000).
-- Everything else that crosses today's thresholds still files a WARNING
-- incident (one push at raise per notification policy), so nothing goes
-- silent; only the repeat-page-on-oscillation stops.
