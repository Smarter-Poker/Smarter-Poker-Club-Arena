-- ============================================================================
--  PHASE 4 OF 9 (part 2) - THE THAW RUNS IN INSTALLMENTS, SO IT CANNOT TIME OUT
--
--  fn_thaw_platform is called by the engine through PostgREST as service_role,
--  whose statement_timeout is 8 seconds. It never once completed before #2703
--  added three partial indexes (it measured 19.9s), and it still carries one
--  step that is proportional to the number of running tournaments: shifting
--  tournaments.level_started_at costs ~20ms per row through the table's seven
--  unconditional UPDATE triggers (121 rows = 2.46s uncontended, measured
--  2026-09-02 23:12 UTC in a rolled-back probe). At :00, with every table
--  waking against a saturated 2-core database, that one statement can take
--  the whole budget on its own, and the 20:00 thaw did time out even with the
--  indexes in place. A timed-out thaw is a thaw that never happened: the
--  transaction rolls back, the ledger row with it, and every clock keeps the
--  frozen minutes it lost.
--
--  THE CHANGE. Same function name, same arguments, same idempotency key, but
--  the work is split into named STEPS and the function does as many as fit
--  inside a self-imposed budget (4s of its own wall clock, leaving the rest of
--  the 8s for lock waits and the one step in flight) before returning
--  {complete: false}. The engine calls it again until {complete: true}. Each
--  call is its own transaction, so every completed step is COMMITTED even if a
--  later call dies. The ledger row's `shifted` JSONB is the checkpoint: a step
--  whose key is present is never run twice. The tournaments step is further
--  chunked by primary key (40 rows per call, cursor in the same JSONB), so no
--  single statement is ever larger than ~1s.
--
--  THE SAME SHIFT FOR EVERY STEP. frozen_seconds is read from the ledger row
--  once it exists, not from the argument. Two engines racing at :00 (a cutover)
--  may measure the freeze a second apart; the platform still moves by exactly
--  one number.
--
--  CONCURRENCY. Each call takes SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on the ledger row, so two
--  callers on the same freeze serialise per call and the second sees the
--  first's checkpoints. Losing the race is still success.
--
--  NOT A MONEY PATH. Only deadline columns move; no balance, stack or ledger
--  amount is read or written. chip_transactions.reversible_until is the
--  cashier claim-back WINDOW, not an amount. The freeze_bypass GUC pattern is
--  unchanged.
