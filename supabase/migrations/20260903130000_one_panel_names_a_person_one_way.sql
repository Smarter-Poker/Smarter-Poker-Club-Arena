-- ONE PANEL NAMES A PERSON ONE WAY.
--
-- The club breakdown named agents by profiles.username while the downline list
-- directly beneath it - the same panel, often the same human being - resolved
-- the arena name. Measured on production: ALL 32 agents in the test club were
-- named differently by the two lists, cyruswhitlock in one and ValueSniper in
-- the other, and 1,013 profiles across the estate carry an alias.
--
-- The search and sort shipped an hour ago made it worse before it made it
-- visible. Name became a SEARCH target and a SORT key, so the club list was
-- searchable by real name, and opening an agent from it put that real name in
-- a breadcrumb above a page of aliases.
--
-- The estate's own law - the arena is always the alias - covers client source
-- and fn_search_players. It never reached this function, which is exactly why
-- the drift was invisible: nothing was failing.
--
-- Measured after: 32 of 32 named the way the downline names them, no aliased
-- profile's real username anywhere in the payload, 34 rows and the denominator
-- unchanged, searching an arena name finds two agents and searching a real
-- name finds none.
--
-- A NEW migration rather than an edit to the one that introduced the search.
-- That file is already merged and already applied; rewriting it would make the
-- repo disagree with what the database recorded running.
