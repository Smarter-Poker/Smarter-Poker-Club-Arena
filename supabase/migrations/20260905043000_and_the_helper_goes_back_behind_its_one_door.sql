--  AND THE HELPER GOES BACK BEHIND ITS ONE DOOR
--  Club Operations upgrade, phase 7 of 8. Correction to 20260905042100.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
-- 20260905042100 shipped the right query behind the WRONG GRANT. It carried
--
--     GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.fn_ca_rake_by_agent(...)
--       TO authenticated, service_role;
--
-- copied from the shape every gated RPC in this programme uses, into the one
-- family where that shape is forbidden. `fn_ca_rake_by_agent` IS NOT GATED.
-- It computes `v_cost` and `v_over` to decide which COLUMNS a caller may see,
-- and then reads the club's whole agent breakdown regardless of who asked. Its
-- gate lives one level up, in `ca_rake_snapshot`, which is why every one of its
-- siblings - fn_ca_rake_window, fn_ca_rake_series, fn_ca_rake_by_club,
-- fn_ca_rake_by_downline - is granted to `service_role` alone.
--
-- So for the twelve minutes between the two applies, any signed-in user could
-- call it with any club id and read that club's per-agent rake, hands and
-- commission totals. The grant was closed the moment it was found, with a
-- REVOKE against production (a grant change fires no PostgREST schema reload,
-- CLAUDE.md section 2), and this migration is the repo catching up with it.
--
-- `tests/the-rake-snapshot-denominator-is-not-double-counted.law.test.ts` is
-- what found it, in the full-suite run before the commit, and it found it
-- because the law reads the LATEST migration that mentions the function rather
-- than the one that first defined it. That is the whole value of the pattern:
-- a law that only checked the original grant would have passed here.
--
-- The body below is byte-identical to 20260905042100's - re-issued, not
-- edited, because an applied migration is never changed (AGENT-PLAYBOOK) and
-- because the law reads the newest file that names the function, so a
-- grants-only correction would have left it reading a file with no body in it.
