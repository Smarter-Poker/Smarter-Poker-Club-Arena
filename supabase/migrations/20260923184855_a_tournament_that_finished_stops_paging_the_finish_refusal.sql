-- A TOURNAMENT THAT FINISHED STOPS PAGING THE FINISH REFUSAL.
--
-- Production Alerts board: operational_alert_events id=8, MoneyAlertsGoingUnread
-- (open since 2026-09-13, firing at 30x its threshold). financial_alerts has
-- 46,366 unresolved critical rows. Read live before writing this migration:
-- the single largest source is Tournament.atomic_finish_refused at 15,426 rows
-- (33% of the whole backlog) across only 1,003 distinct tournaments - one
-- tournament, f670ca7c, alone carries 224 of them, all between 2026-09-14 and
-- 2026-09-21.
--
-- WHY THEY NEVER RESOLVE. TournamentManagerEliminations.ts raises this alert
-- every time atomic_finish is refused mid-retry (noteFinishRefusal /
-- alertFinishRefusalOnce, around line 5307) and keeps retrying with a backoff
-- (finishRetryDelayMs). That retry loop is correct and is not touched here -
-- the eventual retry succeeds, the tournament reaches COMPLETED, the winner is
-- paid. What never happens is anyone going back to close the alert rows the
-- failed attempts left behind. fn_resolve_settled_financial_alerts already
-- runs every 20 minutes (cron job ca-resolve-settled-alerts-20m) and already
-- has exactly this shape for a different source - CLASS 1 below closes
-- fn_payout_guarantee_check's earner_not_paid alert once a wallet_transactions
-- prize credit proves the player was paid - but Tournament.atomic_finish_refused
-- and its outcome_unknown sibling were never added to it. So the same true
-- fact (the player got paid) can resolve one alert shape and not the other.
--
-- PROVEN LIVE, not assumed from elapsed time or the tournament's own
-- COMPLETED status (which the manager sets itself and so is not independent
-- proof): for every one of the 1,003 distinct tournaments behind an
-- unresolved Tournament.atomic_finish_refused alert, and 30 of the 35 behind
-- Tournament.atomic_finish_outcome_unknown, a wallet_transactions row exists
-- crediting the exact winner_id named in the alert's own context, for that
-- exact tournament_id, type=credit category=prize. That is the same proof
-- CLASS 1 already trusts for the same reason: the prize path is the one
-- authoritative payer, so a credit from it is settlement, independent of
-- whatever the manager's own retries recorded about themselves.
--
-- tournament_finish_receipts (5,707 rows) was checked first as a candidate
-- proof source and rejected: zero of the 1,084 affected tournaments have a row
-- there. It is a certificate path for a narrower case, not the general finish
-- receipt, and using it here would have left the entire backlog unresolved
-- again while looking like a fix.
--
-- SCOPE. This closes Tournament.atomic_finish_refused and
-- Tournament.atomic_finish_outcome_unknown only - non-satellite finishes.
-- Tournament.atomic_satellite_finish_refused (469 rows, 39 distinct
-- tournaments) and Tournament.atomic_satellite_finish_outcome_unknown (7 rows)
-- were not verified this run: a satellite's payout is seats awarded, not
-- necessarily a single wallet prize credit, so CLASS 1's proof shape does not
-- automatically transfer and claiming it does without checking would be the
-- same mistake this migration is fixing. Left open for a follow-up that reads
-- the satellite award path on its own terms. Satellite.stuck_completing_unawarded
-- (533 rows) and the weekly accounting sources (358 rows) are likewise
-- untouched here.
--
-- HARDENING (CLAUDE.md 10.11/10.12): the cause is the missing class in the
-- resolver, not a new sweep - fn_resolve_settled_financial_alerts already runs
-- on its existing 20-minute cron, so this needs no new schedule and creates no
-- new repair job. The regression test
-- (server/src/tournament/AFinishedTournamentStopsPagingTheRefusal.guard.test.ts)
-- pins the exact SQL added. Detection needs nothing new: MoneyAlertsGoingUnread
-- already measures the backlog this closes a third of.
