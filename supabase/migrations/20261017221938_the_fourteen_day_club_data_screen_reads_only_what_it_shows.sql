-- WHAT THIS CHANGES, AND WHY
--
-- Dan 2026-10-17: "The 14-day view of the main screen takes about 4 seconds
-- for a club as busy as JAQK." 20261017204111 was measured at 1.05 s as a
-- free-standing query and then read 3.79 s on production inside the
-- function: grouping 450,000 fact rows into 248,000 games to choose 200, and
-- a per-game player count planned as one range scan per game.
--
-- The plain screen (no game, stakes or search filter) now takes its totals in
-- one aggregate, chooses its rows newest day first, and totals, counts and
-- describes only those rows by exact (club, day, game) lookups. Measured as
-- pieces on production: totals 0.43 s + 0.29 s, candidates 0.02 s, page rows
-- 0.03 s. A filtered screen keeps the full form, with its player count on the
-- same exact lookups. Same answer; the screen's scenario is re-run against it.
--
-- One function, one transaction. No table is touched.
