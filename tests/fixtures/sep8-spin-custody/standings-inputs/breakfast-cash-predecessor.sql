       the knockout door RECORDS a bust, so a bust the door recorded hours
       late was paid a place it did not finish in. Each eliminated row is now
       ranked by when its bust happened, derived in the statement that uses
       it from what the door proved: the commit time of the accepted hand of
       the player's latest 'eliminated' knockout generation, plus one
       microsecond per earlier rank in that hand (smaller hand-start stack
       first, then user id - the rule the door stamps eliminated_at with).
       Busts in different hands are ordered by those hands' commit times.
       The hand-history prune deletes a horse-only hand's commit row after
       its retention window, and only a PENDING generation protects it; the
       generation rows themselves are never pruned, so a hand whose commit
       is gone is timed by when its first generation was captured (the
       earliest created_at of that hand's generations, written before the
       commit) - one time for the whole hand, so the same-hand stack rank
       still decides within it - never by when a bust was recorded. A row
       with no such witness keeps its eliminated_at; a row with neither is
       refused, never guessed. Equal times fall back to
       elimination_sequence, then id. elimination_sequence alone still names
       the last elimination, and so the winner, above. The same order decides
       whether anything moves, so a ladder already in true order is left
       exactly as it is. */
